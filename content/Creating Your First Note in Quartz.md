## Frontmatter
Assuming you have already setuped the Quartz we can move forward now

So creating notes each time with [[#This is frontmatter|frontmatter]] is annoying so we are going to make sure `Template Plugin` is active , it's a core plugin so you do not have to install it.
You can set Shortcut to `Ctrl+T` or `Alt+T` for easier access

###### This is frontmatter
